# Day 7: Web Dashboard & Final Polish

## Today's Goal
Develop a simple Streamlit web dashboard to visualize financial data and perform a final polish of the CLI application.

## Learning Focus
- Streamlit application development
- Data visualization techniques
- User Interface (UI) design principles
- Integrating existing data backend with a new frontend

## Fintech Concepts
- **Dashboard**: A visual display of key financial metrics and data.
- **Data Visualization**: Presenting data graphically for easier understanding.
- **User Experience (UX)**: Designing for ease of use and satisfaction.

## Web Dashboard Features

### 1. Overview Dashboard
- **Recent Transactions**: Display a table of the latest transactions.
    - Color code income (green) and expenses (red).
- **Current Month Summary**: Show total income, total expenses, and current balance for the month.
- **Budget Performance**: Display a high-level overview of budget adherence (e.g., categories over budget).

### 2. Spending Breakdown
- **Category Spending Chart**: A bar or pie chart showing spending distribution across categories for the current month.
- **Month-over-Month Comparison**: Simple charts showing income and expense trends.

### 3. Recommendations
- Display financial recommendations (similar to the smart assistant CLI command).

## CLI Polishing Goals

1.  **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Ensure all commands gracefully handle unexpected inputs or file issues.
2.  **User-Friendly Prompts**: Review all user interactions for clarity and helpfulness.
3.  **Consistent Output**: Maintain a consistent look and feel across all CLI commands.
